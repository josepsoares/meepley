&nbsp;
This is a simple puppeteer scraper used to get data from the [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com) website. It was develop because the [BGG XML API v2](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) is somewhat lackluster.
All the data got from the scraper is stored in the data directory in .json files

## Running the scraper

```bash
# command to get all the boardgames in the ranking
# this one takes a lot of time to finish... get some snacks 🍿 🥪 🍹
$ yarn puppeteer:bgg-ranks

# command to acquire all the boardgame categories
$ yarn puppeteer:bgg-categories

# get boardgame mechanics
$ yarn puppeteer:bgg-mechanics
```
